I am currently a third year undergraduate student in Mathematics at CSJM University, Kanpur. I am quite interested in the mathematical field of Abstract Algebra while also trying to learn more about Category Theory, Representation Theory and Homological Algebra.

The motivation behind this webpage is to gather my notes, literary writings and other helpful resources.
My blog can be accessed <a href="https://purnimamath.blogspot.com/">here</a>.
